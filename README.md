# CEC_Java_Practice_Demo
Made a Java version of my team's CEC project from March (see https://github.com/Andrew-Fryer/CEC_2020)

To run this code, you will need to create a new Java project with at least sdk 11. Once a new project has been created, add these files, replacing the main.java file with the one in this project. 
The project is incomplete but I do plan on finishing it over the next little while so stay tuned. 
A full version not requiring the setup of a new project will be coming soon.
